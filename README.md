# RADIUS Accounting to Palo-Alto Networks Firewall User-ID Agent

The Lithnet PAN RA Proxy is a windows service that receives RADIUS accounting requests, and submits them as User-ID updates to a Palo Alto firewall via its web service. While compatible with any RADIUS accounting system, this tool can be used to ensure the PAN firewall receives user-id updates from authentication using Microsoft Network Policy Server.
